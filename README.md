# List Pagination
A front-end project to sort through large lists of data and present it in a readable fashion


## Background 
Created for Project 2 of the Treehouse Fullstack Tech Degree. 

Although the project only calls for creating multiple pages to sort the list by, I went for the "extra credit" option. I created the search functionality, in addition 
to what was required to pass this project. 

I'm interested in feedback for how I handled the error message when no users are displayed. I feel like it's very "clucky". 

### Future Improvements 

1. I need to refactor the code. 
2. Allowing users to manipulate the students on the list
